// NewMountCommand makes a mount command with the given name and Mount function

	var commandDefintion = &cobra.Command{
		Use:   commandName + " remote:path /path/to/mountpoint",
		Short: `Mount the remote as a mountpoint. **EXPERIMENTAL**`,
		Long: `
rclone ` + commandName + ` allows Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows to
mount any of Rclone's cloud storage systems as a file system with
FUSE.

This is **EXPERIMENTAL** - use with care.

First set up your remote using ` + "`rclone config`" + `.  Check it works with ` + "`rclone ls`" + ` etc.

Start the mount like this

    rclone ` + commandName + ` remote:path/to/files /path/to/local/mount

Or on Windows like this where X: is an unused drive letter

    rclone ` + commandName + ` remote:path/to/files X:

When the program ends, either via Ctrl+C or receiving a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal,
the mount is automatically stopped.

The umount operation can fail, for example when the mountpoint is busy.
When that happens, it is the user's responsibility to stop the mount manually with

    # Linux
    fusermount -u /path/to/local/mount
    # OS X
    umount /path/to/local/mount

### Installing on Windows ###

To run rclone ` + commandName + ` on Windows, you will need to
download and install [WinFsp](http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/).

WinFsp is an [open source](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp)
Windows File System Proxy which makes it easy to write user space file
systems for Windows.  It provides a FUSE emulation layer which rclone
uses combination with
[cgofuse](https://github.com/billziss-gh/cgofuse).  Both of these
packages are by Bill Zissimopoulos who was very helpful during the
implementation of rclone ` + commandName + ` for Windows.

#### Windows caveats ####

Note that drives created as Administrator are not visible by other
accounts (including the account that was elevated as
Administrator). So if you start a Windows drive from an Administrative
Command Prompt and then try to access the same drive from Explorer
(which does not run as Administrator), you will not be able to see the
new drive.

The easiest way around this is to start the drive from a normal
command prompt. It is also possible to start a drive from the SYSTEM
account (using [the WinFsp.Launcher
infrastructure](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp/wiki/WinFsp-Service-Architecture))
which creates drives accessible for everyone on the system.

### Limitations ###

This can only write files seqentially, it can only seek when reading.
This means that many applications won't work with their files on an
rclone mount.

The bucket based remotes (eg Swift, S3, Google Compute Storage, B2,
Hubic) won't work from the root - you will need to specify a bucket,
or a path within the bucket.  So ` + "`swift:`" + ` won't work whereas
` + "`swift:bucket`" + ` will as will ` + "`swift:bucket/path`" + `.
None of these support the concept of directories, so empty
directories will have a tendency to disappear once they fall out of
the directory cache.

Only supported on Linux, FreeBSD, OS X and Windows at the moment.

### rclone ` + commandName + ` vs rclone sync/copy ##

File systems expect things to be 100% reliable, whereas cloud storage
systems are a long way from 100% reliable. The rclone sync/copy
commands cope with this with lots of retries.  However rclone ` + commandName + `
can't use retries in the same way without making local copies of the
uploads.  This might happen in the future, but for the moment rclone
` + commandName + ` won't do that, so will be less reliable than the rclone command.

### Filters ###

Note that all the rclone filters can be used to select a subset of the
files to be visible in the mount.
